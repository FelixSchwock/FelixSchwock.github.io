**If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?** - *Albert Einstein*

Hi, I'm a Ph.D. student in ECE at the University of Washington supervised by [Prof. Shima Abadi](https://www.ece.uw.edu/people/shima-abadi/) and [Prof. Les Atlas](https://people.ece.uw.edu/atlas/). I'm interested in ocean acoustics, signal processing, and machine learning.
